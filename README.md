# SHARC_buoy_data_transmission
This project deals with implementation of encryption and compression of data from sensors on an STM32F0-discovery. This project aims to provide a solution to the data size problems highlighted in the SHARC Buoy design by [Jamie Nicholas Jacobson](https://github.com/tristynferreiro/SHARC_buoy_data_transmission/blob/main/Docs/thesis_ebe_2021_jacobson%20jamie%20nicholas.pdf). This repo details a solution designed, tested, documented and implemented by Shameeras Cassima and Tristyn Ferreiro.

## Docs/
Contains the documentation of the project. The thesis is a copy of the support behind and background of the project.

### Datasheets/
Contains the data sheets of the components used in this project.

### Reports/
Contains all the reports created throughout the design process of this project. This includes the paper design, two progress reports and the final design report. 

The [final design report]() provides a holistic and detailed description of the sytem's interactions, tests and designs.

## Software/
Contains all the source code used in this project. For both the compression and encryption algorithms, there are multiple veersions of the source code which served different purposes during the design and implementation phases of the project. They are named descriptively.

Both the compression and encryption folders contain READMEs explaining how to compile and run the files.

## Testing/
Contains all the data recorded throughout the design of the system.
