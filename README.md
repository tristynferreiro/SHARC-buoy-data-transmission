# SHARC_buoy_data_transmission

## Software/
Contains all the source code used in this project. For both the compression and encryption algorithms, there are multiple veersions of the source code which served different purposes during the designing and implementation phases of the project.

Both the compression and encryption folders contain READMEs explaining how to compile and run the files.

### SHARC_buoy_transmission_data
This is an STM32Cube project. It contains all the source code to run the algorithms on an STM32F0 board. This can be run using the STM32Cube IDE.
