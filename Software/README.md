# Software
_All folders contain readmes detailing how to compile and run the various programs._

## Compression/
Contains all previously developed versions of the the compression algorithm (lzss) needed for testing. These versions were created throughout the development of the final solution and serve different functions. 

## Encryption-Compression/
Contains all previous developed versions of the the combined algorithm code needed for testing. These versions were created throughout the development of the final solution and serve a different function.

The different versions are:
- SHARC_buoy_transmission_data
- combined_chars.c
- combined_dynamic_key.c
- combined_integers.c

## Encryption/
Contains all previous developed versions of the the encryption algorithm (RSA) needed for testing. These versions were created throughout the development of the final solution and serve different functions.

## Full System (stm32f0)/
Contains the STM32CubeIDE projects and serial scripts used in the final system and sensor interfacing.
